# FlySimChk
Version 0.1.005

This is a proof of concept for a command line tool for reading (and eventually writing) checklists for use in flight simulation games.
It is provided without any warranty and it is still in development.

You can run a pre-built executable from the folded labeled "releases". Check for your operating system. 

Acknowledgments: This project makes extensive use of the PyInquirer project as the basis of the command line interactivity.
You can find more information about that project here: https://pypi.org/project/PyInquirer/ and https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer
